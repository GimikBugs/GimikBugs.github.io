Hey. My name is Matt, but most people know me as Gimik. I'm a father, a husband, a gamer, a hacker, a checker of checkboxesand security enthusiast. Currently I'm wrapping up the last year of my Bachelors Degree in Cybersecurity and working on getting some industy recognized certificates. I have a lot of passions in life, but one of my biggest is hacking - I was bitten by the bug about 1 year ago and have been obsessed ever since!
